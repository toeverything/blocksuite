BlockSuite is a framework providing building blocks for collaborative applications. With BlockSuite, you can build complex applications with fine-grained collaborative features, without going down the rabbit hole of rich text editors and conflict resolution algorithms.

## Introduction

BlockSuite was created initially for [AFFiNE](https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE), an open source knowledge base that attempts to combine the best of Notion and Miro altogether. In reaching such a challenging goal, we found that based on recent tech breakthroughs, we actually don't have to manage all editable content inside a monolith `contenteditable` container like traditional rich text editors. **Instead, based on BlockSuite, regardless of a TodoMVC, a dashboard, or a block-based knowledge base that supports multi-user collaboration, they can all be modeled into regular UI components and rendered to standard DOM, sharing the same object model and mental model**.

BlockSuite provides a toolset for assembling collaborative applications:

- üöß **A centralized store** that serves as a real-time collaborative state management library. It is built on top of [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) and supports zero cost time travel, subscription-based reactivity, and incremental state synchronization over different data persistence layers.
- üöß **A set of block UI components** based on [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). They are framework agnostic and can be reused or extended on demand.
- üöß **A collaborative editor** built on top of the above blocks and store. It's also a Web Component and can be embedded directly into any Web application.

To support a smooth rich-text editing experience, BlockSuite also provides a RichText component. Each RichText instance uses a flat data structure and can be placed as a leaf component in a complex nesting UI. This ensures the stability of rich-text editing (currently based on [Quill](https://quilljs.com/)), but also enables the modeling of complex application states. Since **BlockSuite can reconcile the state of multiple rich text instances**, this eliminates the need for collaborative applications being tied into a single `contenteditable`.

As an example, in the BlockSuite based [AFFiNE Alpha](https://pathfinder.affine.pro/) editor, you may not feel that this editor is actually a composition of multiple RichText components (check out DevTools üëÄ). This demonstrates the flexibility and extensibility of BlockSuite.

## Getting Started

For now, the BlockSuite team is focusing on developing first-party blocks built for AFFiNE, its developer documentation is not yet complete. But the project structure in this repository should already demonstrate some key points about how it's supposed to be reused as a progressive framework:

- The `packages/store` package is a data store built for general purpose state management.
- The `packages/blocks` package holds the default BlockSuite editable blocks.
- The `packages/editor` package ships a complete BlockSuite-based editor.

## Development

Setting up basic local environment:

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm i

# start vite playground
pnpm dev
```

To test locally, please make sure browser binaries are already installed via `npx playwright install` and Vite playground is started with `pnpm dev`. Then there are multi commands to choose from:

```bash
# run tests in headless mode in another terminal window
pnpm test

# or run tests in headed mode for debugging
pnpm test:headed
```

In headed mode, `await page.pause()` can be used in test cases to suspend the test runner.
