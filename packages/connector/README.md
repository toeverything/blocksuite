# `@blocksuite/connector`

## How to use

```ts
import { route, Rectangle } from '@blocksuite/connector';

const rects = [
  new Rectangle(30, 30, 200, 200),
  new Rectangle(160, 160, 300, 300),
];

const points = [
  { x: 50, y: 30 },
  { x: 160, y: 200 },
];

const path = route(rects, points);
console.log('path', path);
```

## Example

See `packages/playground/examples/canvas/connector.html`

## Info

The main idea comes from https://medium.com/swlh/routing-orthogonal-diagram-connectors-in-javascript-191dc2c5ff70 .
The final implementation is based on the idea of the blog and modifies the following parts:

- When generating graph, do not rely on the binding of rectangle and point
- When generating graphs, do not limit the number of rectangles and points
- When the path is finally calculated, select any two points from the graph
- When there are only two points or only one rectangle, manually generate the points of the graph

Problems caused by modifications:

- The Graph becomes larger, and more points.length lines are added, causing the final path point to increase points.length \* 2n
