# ðŸš§ Defining Editable Blocks

::: info
ðŸš§ The implementation of this section is still under development and may be subject to change.

Blocks are scalable in BlockSuite. When building a new block flavour with UI, there are several entities to be defined:

- `BlockSchema`: This is used to determine the data structure of the block model.
- `BlockComponent`: This is used to define the UI component of the block.
- `BlockService`: This is used to provide callback methods for events such as clipboard interactions.

Currently, further standardization of the block UI layer is still in progress. If you're interested in this, you can directly refer to the implementation in [`@blocksuite/blocks`](https://github.com/toeverything/blocksuite/tree/master/packages/blocks/src) as a reference.
