# Pie Menu

The Pie Menu widget offers users a visually intuitive and efficient way to access various functions through a single radial menu activated by a single key press. Inspired by Blender's interface, this widget offers enhanced functionality for streamlined workflow.

# Usage

- Trigger Key: Each menu is associated with a trigger key to open it. To activate a menu, press and hold the trigger key.

- Navigation: While holding the trigger key, move the cursor towards the desired action within the pie menu. Hovering over a segment of the pie menu highlights that action. Release the trigger key to select the highlighted action.

- Submenu: Submenus can be accessed by hovering over the submenu node (with a blue dot) within the pie menu. This allows for nested menu structures for organizing functions. To close a submenu just hover over the desired center node

- Keeping Menu Open: If the trigger key is released before the "SELECT_ON_RELEASE_TIMEOUT" threshold, the pie menu remains open, allowing for multiple selections without reopening the menu.

- Shortcut Selection: The numeric keys (0-9) correspond to actions within the pie menu. Pressing a numeric key selects the action associated with that number directly active (this does not work for color nodes).

Enhance your workflow by utilizing the Pie Menu widget for swift and intuitive access to various functions with minimal keystrokes.
