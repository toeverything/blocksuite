# Pie Menu

This widget allows users with a visually intuitive and efficient way to access various functions in a single radial menu in a single key press. This widget is inspired from blender and works similar and has more functionality.

The submenu can be opened by hovering at the submenu node

If you released the key before 'SELECT_ON_RELEASE_TIMEOUT' then you can keep the pie menu opened
