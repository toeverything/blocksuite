# Frame Block

This is a block used to mark a canvas area in the edgeless editor.

When dragging the frame, the elements placed inside the frame move together with the frame. Note that there are no other blocks inside the frame. This association effect is based on the geometric area covered by the frame, not on a nested relationship at the model layer.

In presentation mode, the viewport will be moved to focus the frames one after another.
