# Paragraph Block

This is a block used to place text content. It's generally placed inside a note block, but also supports nesting by pressing the tab key.

- When the `type` value of this block is `text`, it displays as a sequence of texts.
- When the `type` value of this block is `h1` / `h2` / `h3` / `h4` / `h5` / `h6`, it displays as titles of different levels.
- When the `type` value of this block is `quote`, it displays as a quote.
