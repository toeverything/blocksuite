# Class: CommandManager

Command manager to manage all commands

Commands are functions that take a context and a next function as arguments

```ts
const myCommand: Command<input, output> = (ctx, next) => {
 const count = ctx.count || 0;

 const success = someOperation();
 if (success) {
   return next({ count: count + 1 });
 }
 // if the command is not successful, you can return without calling next
 return;
```

Command input and output data can be defined in the `Command` type

```ts
// input: ctx.firstName, ctx.lastName
// output: ctx.fullName
const myCommand: Command<{ firstName: string; lastName: string }, { fullName: string }> = (ctx, next) => {
  const { firstName, lastName } = ctx;
  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
  return next({ fullName });
}

```

---

Commands can be run in two ways:

1. Using `exec` method
`exec` is used to run a single command
```ts
const [result, data] = commandManager.exec(myCommand, payload);
```

2. Using `chain` method
`chain` is used to run a series of commands
```ts
const chain = commandManager.chain();
const [result, data] = chain
  .pipe(myCommand1)
  .pipe(myCommand2, payload)
  .run();
```

---

Command chains will stop running if a command is not successful

```ts
const chain = commandManager.chain();
const [result, data] = chain
  .chain(myCommand1) <-- if this fail
  .chain(myCommand2, payload) <- this won't run
  .run();

result <- result will be `false`
```

You can use `try` to run a series of commands and if one of them is successful, it will continue to the next command
```ts
const chain = commandManager.chain();
const [result, data] = chain
  .try(chain => [
    chain.pipe(myCommand1), <- if this fail
    chain.pipe(myCommand2, payload), <- this will run, if this success
    chain.pipe(myCommand3), <- this won't run
  ])
  .run();
```

The `tryAll` method is similar to `try`, but it will run all commands even if one of them is successful
```ts
const chain = commandManager.chain();
const [result, data] = chain
  .try(chain => [
    chain.pipe(myCommand1), <- if this success
    chain.pipe(myCommand2), <- this will also run
    chain.pipe(myCommand3), <- so will this
  ])
  .run();
```

## Methods

### chain()

> **chain**(): `Chain`\<`InitCommandCtx`\>

Create a chain to run a series of commands
```ts
const chain = commandManager.chain();
const [result, data] = chain
  .myCommand1()
  .myCommand2(payload)
  .run();
```

#### Returns

`Chain`\<`InitCommandCtx`\>

[success, data] - success is a boolean to indicate if the chain is successful,
  data is the final context after running the chain

***

### created()

> **created**(): `void`

Called when std is created.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`LifeCycleWatcher`](LifeCycleWatcher.md).[`created`](LifeCycleWatcher.md#created)

***

### mounted()

> **mounted**(): `void`

Called when editor host is mounted.
Which means the editor host emit the `connectedCallback` lifecycle event.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`LifeCycleWatcher`](LifeCycleWatcher.md).[`mounted`](LifeCycleWatcher.md#mounted)

***

### rendered()

> **rendered**(): `void`

Called when `std.render` is called.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`LifeCycleWatcher`](LifeCycleWatcher.md).[`rendered`](LifeCycleWatcher.md#rendered)

***

### unmounted()

> **unmounted**(): `void`

Called when editor host is unmounted.
Which means the editor host emit the `disconnectedCallback` lifecycle event.

#### Returns

`void`

#### Inherited from

[`LifeCycleWatcher`](LifeCycleWatcher.md).[`unmounted`](LifeCycleWatcher.md#unmounted)
