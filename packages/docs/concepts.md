# Fundamental Concepts

BlockSuite is an extensible framework that allows users to create and edit structured content by organizing blocks. In this document, we will introduce the core concepts of BlockSuite, including _workspaces_, _pages_, and _blocks_.

## Workspaces and Pages

BlockSuite is centered around the concept of blocks. However, to handle a large number of blocks efficiently, the blocks are organized into workspaces and pages. Workspace is the highest-level container for managing and organizing pages, and each workspace can hold multiple pages. Page is the sub-container for organizing blocks, and each page contains a strongly typed block tree.

### Workspaces

A `Workspace` in BlockSuite acts as a top-level container for managing and organizing pages. By creating workspaces, users can group and categorize different sets of pages, each representing a specific project or a collection of related content. Here is how we create a new workspace:

```ts
import { Workspace } from '@blocksuite/store';

const workspace = new Workspace({ id: 'hello' });

// We can register a batch of blocks to the workspace
workspace.register(AffineSchemas);
```

### Pages

A `Page` in BlockSuite serves as the actual container for organizing blocks, allowing users to operate on the block tree through its APIs. In typical scenarios involving rich text documents, one document is represented by a single page within a workspace.

Here is how we create a new page with id `page0` within the workspace:

```ts
const page = workspace.createPage('page0');
```

## Flavoured Blocks

In BlockSuite, block is the basic unit of structured content, representing a piece of text, an image or other media elements, or even a nested sub-document. BlockSuite supports defining various types of blocks, referred to as **flavoured blocks**. By combining and nesting blocks, users can create richly structured and styled content.

The term "flavour" in blocks is inspired by the concept in physics and follows the `namespace:name` format. For example, we allow an `affine:paragraph` block to have similar sub-types, such as `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `quote`, etc., which reduces redundant code and makes it easier for blocks with similar behavior to be converted between each other.

### Basic Block Operation APIs

In BlockSuite, the basic APIs for managing blocks include `addBlock`, `updateBlock`, and `deleteBlock`. These operations allow users to create, modify, and remove blocks within a `page`, providing an easy way to manage and organize the structured content.

The `page.addBlock` method takes two required arguments: `flavour` and `props`. The `flavour` argument is the type of block to be added, while `props` contains the properties for the new block. Optionally, you can use the `parent` and `parentIndex` arguments to specify the parent block and the index at which the new block should be inserted, respectively.

Example usage:

```ts
import { Text } from '@blocksuite/store';

const props = { text: new Text('New paragraph') };
const newBlockId = page.addBlock('affine:paragraph', props);
```

`page.addBlock` returns the auto-generated `id` of the added block, rather than the block instance. The block instance will be added synchronously to the page, and can be retrieved by calling `page.getBlockById(id)`.

::: info
These is a good reason behind this design, which is the key to make the APIs collaborative by default (ðŸš§).
:::

The `page.updateBlock` method is used to modify the properties of an existing block. It takes two arguments: the block instance to be updated and an object containing the updated properties.

Example usage:

```ts
const props = { text: new Text('New paragraph') };
page.updateBlock(block, props);
```

Similarly, you can use the `page.deleteBlock` method to remove a block from the block tree.

In [BlockSuite playground](https://blocksuite-toeverything.vercel.app/?init), you can run `workspace.doc.toJSON()` in the console to see the basic block structure in BlockSuite.

### Basic Block Flavours

In the prebuilt editor, creating a simple page requires following block flavours: `affine:page`, `affine:frame`, and `affine:paragraph`.

- The `affine:page` block serves as the top-level container for a page, holding all other blocks within the page hierarchy.
- The `affine:frame` block acts as a flat container within the page, and multiple frames can be positioned on the whiteboard.
- Each `affine:paragraph` block holds a linear sequence of rich text within the page. It enables users to create text-based content and style it according to their needs.

::: tip
The `affine:frame` block is designed to interop with the whiteboard mode. If you only need the document editor, simply placing all other blocks within a single frame will be sufficient.

To provide an out-of-the-box solution, the `affine:code`, `affine:list`, and `affine:embed` flavours are also built into the `AffineSchema` and can be freely reused.
