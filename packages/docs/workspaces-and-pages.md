# Workspaces and Pages

BlockSuite is centered around the concept of blocks. However, to handle a large number of blocks efficiently, the blocks are organized into workspaces and pages. `Workspace` is the highest-level container that can hold multiple pages. `Page` is the sub-container for organizing blocks, and each page contains a strongly typed block tree.

## Workspaces

A `Workspace` in BlockSuite acts as a top-level container for organizing pages. By creating workspaces, users can group and categorize different sets of pages, each representing a specific project or a collection of related content. Here is how we create a new workspace:

```ts
import { Workspace } from '@blocksuite/store';

const workspace = new Workspace({ id: 'foo' });

// We can register a batch of blocks to the workspace
workspace.register(AffineSchemas);
```

## Pages

A `Page` in BlockSuite serves as the actual container for organizing blocks, allowing users to operate on the block tree through its APIs. In typical scenarios involving rich text documents, one document is represented by a single page within a workspace.

Here is how we create a new page with id `page0` within the workspace:

```ts
const page = workspace.createPage({ id: 'page0' });
```

The `page` instance provides a set of core APIs for performing block operations, e.g., `page.addBlock`, `page.updateBlock`, and `page.deleteBlock`. These APIs will be further introduced in the following sections of the document.
