# BlockSuite Contributor License Agreement

This agreement is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the BlockSuite and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your past, present and future contributions submitted to BlockSuite. You should sign this agreement before submitting your first contribution. Except for the license granted herein to BlockSuite and recipients of software distributed by BlockSuite, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. Parties.

   (a) "BlockSuite" refers to the project's operator, TOEVERYTHING PTE. LTD registered in Republic of Singapore.

   (b) "You" (or "Your") means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with BlockSuite.

2. Definitions. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to BlockSuite for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by BlockSuite (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to BlockSuite or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, BlockSuite for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution".

3. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to BlockSuite and to recipients of software distributed by BlockSuite a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to use, copy, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, distribute, sublicense, and publicly perform and display the Contribution and such derivative works on any licensing terms, including without limitation open source licenses and binary, proprietary, or commercial licenses.

4. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to BlockSuite and to recipients of software distributed by BlockSuite a perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contribution in whole or in part, alone or in combination with or included in any product, work or materials arising out of the project to which your contribution was submitted, and to sublicense these same rights to third parties through multiple levels of sublicensees or other licensing arrangements.

5. Except as set out above, You keep all right, title, and interest in your contribution. The rights that you grant to BlockSuite under these terms are effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to BlockSuite, even if your submission took place before the date you sign these terms.

6. You promise that:

- Each of Your Contributions is Your original work and that you are legally entitled to grant the above license.
- Each of Your Contributions does not to the best of your knowledge violate any third party’s copyrights, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property rights;
- Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.
- If You are an individual and if your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions to BlockSuite, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with BlockSuite.

7. You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
