# BlockSuite Contributor License Agreement

This agreement is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of the BlockSuite and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your past, present and future contributions submitted to BlockSuite. You should sign this agreement before submitting your first contribution. Except for the license granted herein to BlockSuite and recipients of software distributed by BlockSuite, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

   (b) "You" (or "Your") means the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with BlockSuite.

2. Definitions. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to BlockSuite for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by BlockSuite (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to BlockSuite or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, BlockSuite for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution".

5. Except as set out above, You keep all right, title, and interest in your contribution. The rights that you grant to BlockSuite under these terms are effective on the date you first submitted a contribution to BlockSuite, even if your submission took place before the date you sign these terms.

6. You promise that:

- Each of Your Contributions is Your original work and that you are legally entitled to grant the above license.

7. You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
