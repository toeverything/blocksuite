You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your past, present and future contributions submitted to BlockSuite. You should sign this agreement before submitting your first contribution. Except for the license granted herein to BlockSuite and recipients of software distributed by BlockSuite, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

2. Definitions. "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to BlockSuite for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by BlockSuite (the "Work").
