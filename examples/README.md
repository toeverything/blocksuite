# BlockSuite Examples

This collection showcases how to integrate, use, and configure BlockSuite across various common project setups.

## Install

These examples are built and maintained independently from the packages in the monorepo. It's a standalone [workspace](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) that installs BlockSuite canary versions published on npm, instead of using the `workspace:*` reference.

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Run Example

```sh
pnpm dev example-name
```
